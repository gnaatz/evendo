## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this SRS is to discribe the requirements of our complete Application.
The Main focus is the Android-App.

### 1.2 Scope

The Evendo Appllication helps you to stay organized. It provides the opportunity to assign ToDos directly to an Event in one of your calendars. You will never forget a pre-meeting task if you use Evendo.

You can create Calendars, Events and ToDos or create ToDos connected to an Event. You will be able to even import RAPLA or any ical file you wish.
The Data will be saved on a backend Server so you can log on on multiple devices.
You will find our UseCase models here - [4. Supporting Information](#)
