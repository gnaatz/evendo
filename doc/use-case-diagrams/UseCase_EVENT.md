## 1. Use-Case Create Event
### 1.1 Brief Description
This use case is for creating new entries to the calendar, called events.

## 2. Flow of Events
### 2.1 Basic Flow

#### 2.1.2 Mock up

### 2.2 Alternative Flows
There are no alternative possible flows discussed. Only our Basic Flow should work.
### 2.3 Feature File

## 3. Preconditions
1. The user has to be logged in
2. The call has to be sent by the android client
3. All required parameters should be given.

## 4. Postconditions
After sending request to the service the service should return a success entry in database for this user. The client should sync this service with the local stored data.

## 5. Function Points Calculation
This Usecase has a classification of 42.3 Function Points. This is how we calculated the score:
![FunctionPointsCalculation1](https://github.com/gnaatz/evendo/blob/docu/doc/function-points/CreateEvent01.png)
![FunctionPointsCalculation2](https://github.com/gnaatz/evendo/blob/docu/doc/function-points/CreateEvent02.png)


Compared to our other usecases, this score is pretty high. The reason is that creating an event to your calendar is pretty much more complicated than changing the current day (this only implies an select). Add an event implies an insert, maybe an update and of course a select. As well as a lot of function calls for sending invitations to other users. You can see our overall function points diagram down here:
